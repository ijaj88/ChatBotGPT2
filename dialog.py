There are regex based tools you can use but they tend to create bias due to repetitive patterns, so it's better to use language models for this case. A good model to use is a generative model (namely, [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5) here) fine-tuned on [Quora Question Pairs dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/glue?hl=en#glueqqp). This dataset consists of question pairs that are paraphrase of one another, and T5 can generate a paraphrased question given a source question. There's a similar dataset called [MRPC](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/glue?hl=en#gluemrpc) that assesses if one sentence is a paraphrase of another, you can choose between one of them.")

You can either translate the intent classification data and responses and train another model and deploy it,, or you can put translation models at two ends. There are advantages and disadvantages in both approaches. For the first one, you can assess the performance of the model and hand your responses to a native speaker to have more control over what your bot says, but it requires more resources compared to second one. For the second one, assume that you're making a chatbot that is in English and want to have another language, say, German. You need two models, from German to English and from English to German.")

The response will be translated back to German, which you can do in advance and do proofreading with a native speaker or directly pass it to a from English to German language model. For this use case, I highly recommend specific translation models instead of using sequence-to-sequence multilingual models like T5. ")
